Core Components & Features

Intelligent Decision Engine

Analyze campaign goals (CPA, ROAS, Conversions, etc.), type (brand, remarketing, prospecting), stage (new, stable, recently edited), history, and time context.

Decide whether to take action (adjust budget, pause keywords), wait/monitor, or request clarification.

Daily Campaign Evaluator

Run daily (or scheduled).

For each campaign, review performance vs. goals.

Factor in recency of changes, seasonality, patterns.

Output one of: ✅ Actionable Suggestion, ⌛ Wait & Watch, 🧐 Needs Clarification.

Provide a visible daily summary: “Today’s Smart Recommendations.”

Optimization Goal Intelligence

Allow per-account/campaign goal setting.

Default goals: maximize conversions under X cost, maximize ROAS, maximize impressions.

Accept natural-language goals like: “I want leads under ₹300, even if impressions drop.”

Anchor all AI decisions to these goals.

Multi-Account Management

Support unlimited accounts (via OAuth + MCC linking).

Provide a master dashboard with performance overview, daily highlights, and filtering.

Role-Based Access Control

Roles: Admin (view + apply), Manager (view + suggest only), Client (read-only).

Permissions enforced at account and campaign levels.

Multi-AI Recommendation Engine

Integrate multiple AI models (OpenAI, Perplexity, Claude/Mistral optional).

Each recommendation must include:

Model used

Reasoning trail

Confidence score

Cross-validation option: another AI validates/disagrees; show side-by-side reasoning.

Change Awareness & Burn-In Handling

Track recent edits and avoid premature optimization.

Example: “Campaign modified 2 days ago, monitoring for 5 more days before deciding.”

Configurable burn-in periods.

AI Thought Process Visibility

Every recommendation has a clear explanation.

Example: “Paused keyword ‘xyz’ after ₹1,000 spent with zero conversions over 10 days.”

1-Click Apply (Optional)

If user permissions allow, AI can directly implement via Google Ads API.

Always show preview before applying and maintain an audit trail.

Natural Language Chat Interface (Optional, Phase 2)

Users can ask questions like:

“What changed today?”

“Why is Campaign X underperforming?”

“Suggest top 3 fixes this week.”

Example Scenarios

Scenario 1: Underperforming Campaign

CPA above target, edited 2 days ago.

AI says: “No action yet. Observe for 3 more days.”

Scenario 2: High-Spending Wasted Keyword

AI flags keyword with ₹500 spend, 0 conversions in 8 days.

Suggest pausing, alternate AI agrees, user applies.

Scenario 3: High-Performance Campaign

AI suggests increasing budget by 15% for strong ROAS performer.
