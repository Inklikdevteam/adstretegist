## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Authentication**: Sign in with your Google account that has access to Google Ads
2. **Connect Accounts**: Link your Google Ads manager accounts
3. **Select Accounts**: Choose which accounts to analyze and optimize
4. **Set Goals**: Define CPA, ROAS, or custom objectives for your campaigns
5. **Monitor Recommendations**: Review AI-generated suggestions and apply optimizations

### Setting Campaign Goals

Navigate to the **Settings** page to configure campaign objectives:

- **Target CPA**: Set cost-per-acquisition goals
- **Target ROAS**: Define return on ad spend targets  
- **Custom Descriptions**: Add context-specific goals in natural language

### Understanding Recommendations

The AI system categorizes suggestions into three types, with consensus scoring:

- **üéØ Actionable Changes**: Ready-to-implement optimizations with high AI consensus
- **üëÅÔ∏è Monitor**: Areas requiring attention but no immediate action needed
- **‚ùì Clarification**: Requests for additional context or decisions

**AI Consensus Features**:
- **Agreement Level**: Shows how much AI models agree (0-100%)
- **Multi-Model Insights**: Combines analysis from multiple AI providers
- **Provider Attribution**: Shows which AI models contributed to each recommendation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted confidence based on model agreement

### Account Management

Use the account selector to:
- Filter campaigns by specific Google Ads accounts
- View performance across multiple manager accounts
- Maintain consistent filtering across all platform sections

### AI Provider Configuration

The platform automatically detects and uses available AI providers:

**Single Provider Mode**:
- Uses one AI model for recommendations
- Faster response times
- Lower API costs

**Multi-Provider Consensus Mode**:
- Combines insights from all available AI models
- Higher confidence and accuracy
- Cross-validates recommendations
- Shows agreement levels between models

**Provider Auto-Detection**:
- Automatically activates providers with configured API keys
- Gracefully handles missing providers
- Shows active providers in recommendations

## Advanced AI Features

### Multi-AI Consensus Engine

The platform's core strength lies in its ability to leverage multiple AI models simultaneously:

**How Consensus Works**:
1. **Parallel Analysis**: Each available AI provider analyzes the same campaign data independently
2. **Response Aggregation**: All AI responses are collected and compared
3. **Confidence Weighting**: Responses are weighted based on individual model confidence scores
4. **Agreement Calculation**: System calculates how much the models agree (0-100%)
5. **Best Response Selection**: Chooses the most confident response or creates a consensus view
6. **Final Recommendation**: Delivers a single, well-reasoned recommendation with transparency

**Benefits of Multi-AI Approach**:
- **Reduced Bias**: No single AI model's limitations dominate decisions
- **Higher Accuracy**: Cross-validation improves recommendation quality
- **Increased Confidence**: Multiple models agreeing provides higher certainty
- **Fallback Protection**: If one provider fails, others continue working
- **Cost Optimization**: Can use faster/cheaper models for simple tasks, complex models for difficult analysis

### AI Provider Capabilities

**OpenAI GPT-4o**:
- **Strengths**: Advanced reasoning, complex campaign analysis, strategic planning
- **Use Cases**: Multi-step optimizations, budget reallocation strategies, audience insights
- **Output Format**: Structured JSON with detailed reasoning

**Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4**:
